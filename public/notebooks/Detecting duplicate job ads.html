<p>This way we’ll get paired sentences between the texts (this may not work well if every line is a little different, or if the punctuation results in the ads having different sentence structure).</p>

<p>Duplicate ads are likely to only have some small changes, so one approach would be to calculate the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance">Levenshtein Distance</a>; if this is small relative to the length of the ads they are likely to be duplicates.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="detecting-duplicates-at-scale">Detecting Duplicates at Scale</h2>
<p>The problem with the above approach that finding duplicates it’s like trying to find two needles in a haystack of ads</p>
<p>In particular it’s quadratic in the number of ads because we need to compare every pair. If 100 ads takes a minute, then 400k ads will take 30 years.</p>
<p>Instead we use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MinHash">MinHash</a>. Essentially we treat each text as a set of tokens and try to calculate the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaccard_index">Jaccard Similarity</a> between the two texts. Doing this directly would be roughly as slow as edit distance, and require storing all the tokens in memory, so we use a probabalistic approach.</p>
<p>If we pick a random ordering of the elements and just store the smallest one for each document, the probability it is the same for two different documents is (# of tokens in both texts) / (# of tokens in either text), which is exactly the Jaccard Similarity. So if we do this with lots of different random orderings the average number of smallest elements that are the same is approximately the Jaccard Similarity.</p>
<p>We can approximate a random ordering by the output of a family of hash functions generated by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_hashing">Universal Hashing</a> (assuming collisions are relatively low).</p>
<p>So using MinHash reduces the problem of finding sets with high Jaccard Similarity to the problem of finding fixed length sequences with a large number of equal elements. We do this by splitting the hashes into groups called <em>bands</em>; storing the bands of each document in a hashtable and searching for similar documents by doing a lookup on each band in the hashtable. There are some heuristics for finding the best number of bands for a particular Jaccard cutoff.</p>
<p>Thinking about this: another way you could do this would be to keep a <em>sorted</em> collection of each band; this would make it likely that neighbouring elements are close in Jaccard. Is this how <a href="http://ilpubs.stanford.edu:8090/678/1/2005-14.pdf">LSH Forest</a> works?</p>
<p>Anyway the details can be found in <a href="http://www.mmds.org/">Chapter 3 of Mining Massive Datasets by Ullman et al.</a> or <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Probabilistic-Data-Structures-Algorithms-Applications/dp/3748190484">chapter 6 of Gakhov’s Probabilistic Data Structures and Algorithms for Big Data Applications</a>, and are implemented in the nice <a href="http://ekzhu.com/datasketch/">datasketch module</a>.</p>

<p>Arbitrarily let’s look at 4-grams</p>
<ul>
<li>At ~0.7 (3 per million ad pairs): Basically the same ad</li>
<li>At ~0.5 (6 per million ad pairs): Slight edits (which may include the role title!)</li>
<li>At ~0.2 (1 per 10k ad pairs): From the same hirer</li>
<li>At ~0.1 (6 per 10k ad pairs): From the same recruiter</li>
<li>At ~0.05 (1 per 100 ad pairs): Basically unrelated</li>
</ul>
<p>Because advertisers often have common boilerplate this is actually an effective way of finding the same hirer.</p>
