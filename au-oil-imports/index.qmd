title: Australian Oil Imports
---

This is a variation of Sanjoy Mahajan's [The Art of Insight](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/art-insight-science-and-engineering) Section 1.4 (and problem 1.6)

> How much oil does Australia import (in Barrels per Day)?

As in the text we approach this by estimating car consumption.

```{mermaid}
graph BT;
   Import[Oil imports Barrel/Day]

   ImportL[Oil imports L/Day] --> Import
   Barrel[Size of Barrel L] -->|-1| Import
   
   Consumption[Oil consumed L/Day] --> ImportL
   ImportRatio[Oil Imported / Consumed] --> ImportL
   
   CarConsumption[Oil Consumed by Cars L/Day] --> Consumption
   CarFraction[Oil Consumed in Total  / Oil Consumed by Cars] --> Consumption
   
   Cars[Number of Cars] --> CarConsumption
   ConsumptionCar[Oil Consumed by Car L/Day] --> CarConsumption

   People[Number of People] --> Cars
   CarPeople[Number of Cars per Person] --> Cars
```

To estimate imports we estimate demand, since that is estimable.
For oil, if we ignore reserves, then we have imports + production = consumption + exports.
I don't know that Australia is a major oil exporter so I'll assume production and exports can be ignored.
So then production is approximately consumption.

# Estimating Car Consumption

A major use of oil is at petrol for consumer cars.
Let's assume, as in the book, that car use is roughly equal to non-car use.
So All Use/Car Use is 2.

There are 25 million people in Australia.
It's a very car heavy nation; most people have a car.
I'd guess there's around 0.8 cars per person (since this includes people who can't drive).
This gives about 20 million cars.

A consumer probably fills up their car tank about once per week, for say a 40L tank.
This means they use around 5L per day.

So the car overall consumption is about 100ML/day, or about 40 GL/year.
This means the estimated overall consumption is about 200 ML/day.

# Putting it together

A barrel is 160L, so 200 ML/day consumption is about 1.3 million barrels of oil per day.
So our final estimate of imports is 1.3 million barrels per day.
