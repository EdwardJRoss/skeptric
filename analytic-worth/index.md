title: How much is analysis worth?
---

Analytics can be very valuable in helping people make better decisions.
How do you decide how much to invest in an analysis?
You use analytics of course!

A decision consists of a *decision maker* who has a choice of *actions* that can have different *outcomes*.
Analytics helps understand what the outcomes of different actions will be.
This is valuable if it helps the decision maker to choose a different action that leads to a better outcome.

So the gains to a decision maker from analysis is how much better their outcomes will be after the analysis.
Doing a rough estimate of the expected return on an analysis is always worthwhile before investing in it.

1. Who is the decision maker?
2. What are their desired outcomes?
3. What actions can they choose between? (Narrow framing)
4. What's the default action?
5. How much impact could the choices make on the outcomes?
6. How much would it cost to determine 5?
7. What would it take for the decision maker to change their default action?

Default Return: E(default action)
Gross Return: E(analytics action) * P(convince) + E(default action) * (1 - P(convince))
Additional Return: P(convince) * (E(analytics action) - E(default action)) <= E(best action) - E(default action)

Cost: C(analytics) + C(convince) = C(scoping) + C(data collection) + C(synthesis/analytics) + C(communication/influence)


Examples:
Picking a shampoo: Profit <= E(best) - E(worst) ~ \$5/month
If there are no options: Profit = \$0
If someone won't listen to you: Profit = \$0. Other reasons? Justify a decision (brand)

Should I walk to work or drive to minimise time? Very unlikely walking will be faster - not worth investing in.
P(analytics action = default action) ~ 1

How should I invest in data collection, synthesis, communication?
What's going to maximise Profit = Return - Cost?
Iterate!!

Levarage; how often does this decision occur? Two way door?
Competing agents?




A real situation will consist of many agents making interacting decisions to acheive competing outcomes.
