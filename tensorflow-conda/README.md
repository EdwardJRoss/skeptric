To test the code actually works run `make test` on a computer with the pre-requisites

* a Linux machine (including [WSL2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/ai/directml/gpu-cuda-in-wsl))
* an NVIDIA GPU and [appropriate drivers installed](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx) (which you can check by running `nvidia-smi`)
* `conda` installed (for example through [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) or alternatively [mamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html) which is a faster drop in replaement).

This can take a few minutes.
