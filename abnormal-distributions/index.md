Abnormal Distributions
======================

Describing numeric data is often reduced to a few numbers:

 *   average (mean or median)
 *   the best/worst case (maximum or minimum)
 *   the most likely value (mode)
 *   the spread (standard deviation)

The average cost of a house, the daily low and high of a stock price, the most common number of children, the standard deviation of test scores.

Given the unlimited variety of potential data distributions it is impossible to capture their essence in a few numbers.
These numbers can be very misleading when applied to any but the simplest of distributions.

Asymmetrical Averages
---------------------

The concept of "average" makes most sense in a symmetrical distribution.
