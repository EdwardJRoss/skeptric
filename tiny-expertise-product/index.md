title: Packaging your Expertise in a Tiny Product
---

I was listening to the $100 MBA Podcast about [How to Easily Create a Small Information Product](https://100mba.net/mba493/).
I really like the idea of building a tiny product in under 12 hours of work to get experience making something and building [success in small steps](/success-small-steps).

Their basic premise is it's really easy to create a simple product that let's you share your expertise to help people make a small transformation:

* Create a one-page infographic or cheatsheet in Powerpoint and export it as a PDF
* Write a small ebook in a Word processor and convert it to PDF (or an [ebook with Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/epub.html))
* Create some small videos using any HD camera and a USB microphone

Then you can easily use [Gumroad](https://gumroad.com/) for fulfilment, even for a [free product](https://help.gumroad.com/article/132-how-to-create-a-free-product).
This is what Sacha Chua used for her excellent [No-Excuses Guide to Blogging](https://gumroad.com/l/no-excuses-blogging), and as a buyer it was excellent (and I actually paid for it).

# Example Tiny Products

What are some very small products I could create?

* Create a dataset with Common Crawl/Internet Archive
* Setting up a Kaggle-like framework for data science iteration
* Using Fasttext in production
* Finding words that are associated with an outcome
* [Diff testing](/diff-tests)
* Dynamic Rollup Tables with Hyperloglog
* Smart questions for stakeholders when starting an analytics project
* Quickstart to [community detection](/community-detection)
* Easy deployment for machine learning models

I'm not sure whether I will do any of these, but I could create something for each of them in a week.
