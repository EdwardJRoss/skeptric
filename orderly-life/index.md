title: Orderly Life for Original Work
---

> Be settled in your life and as ordinary as the bourgeois, in order to be fierce and original in your works.
>
> Gustave Flaubert, To Gertrude Tennant (December 25, 1876)

Before you can be productive you need to sleep well, eat well, exercise well and have good routines and social supports.
