title: Endurance Counting
---

Counting is a strangely powerful tool for enduring through something.
Standard advice when you're angry is to count to ten.
When stretching counting to a target number helps sustain the stretch longer.

A good counting based technique for endurance is [box breathing](https://www.forbes.com/sites/nomanazish/2019/05/30/how-to-de-stress-in-5-minutes-or-less-according-to-a-navy-seal/).
It involves repeatedly inhaling to a count of 4, holding to a count of 4, exhaling to a count of 4 and holding to a count of 4.
This is a technique used by Navy SEALs to induce calm and focus.
I've personally found it effective for lengthening a cold shower.
