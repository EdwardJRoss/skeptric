In data analysis we tend to use all the data available over large time window.
Technology often makes this easy, but sometimes causes limitations.

# How much precision do we need to make the decision?

Take a smaller sample - technically simpler, can curate and check it more (accuracy, e.g. remove outliers), gives result to precision required.

For ML start small

"More data beats a cleverer algorithm"
Not quite relevant; the paper is very good!


Timesheet example: Toggl vs random sampling.
