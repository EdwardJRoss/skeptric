# Recall and precision in information retrieval
The nomenclature is confusing: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation_measures_(information_retrieval)#Precision
Note that the meaning and usage of "precision" in the field of information retrieval differs from the definition of accuracy and precision within other branches of science and statistics.

## Scripting: Python, Perl and Javascript

Python ecosystem (Numpy, Matplotlib, Scipy)

R

## Dotcom crash

Banner ads

Rise of Advertising and Eccomerce

## Difficulty of making websites

## Microsoft vs Netscape

Best viewed with IE

Mozilla

Google is the new Microsoft

## Flash

Adobe turned it into tracking nightmare

Nothing today seems as easy to make multimedia


## Lack of interactivity

Everything HTML, simpler

AJAX (too many SPA)

## Linux

Linux: 1991

Microsoft anti free software



## XML 

Astronaut Architecture

XML 1.0: 1998

XSLT (1998-99), DSD

XHTML
SOAP

(Good: SVG, RSS, Atom, Office XML!)

Reaction to binary formats

Ant -> Maven

Now: JSON, YAML (YAML templating!)

## Unicode

Very good.

# RDF



## RDF Graph to Dictionary

#### Getting relevant nodes

```
t = rdflib.term.URIRef('http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type')
jp = rdflib.term.URIRef('http://schema.org/JobPosting')
def get_job_postings(G):
    return G.subjects(t, jp)
```

```
list(G.subject_objects(t))
```

```
nodes = set(s for s,p,o in G if type(s) == rdflib.term.BNode)
referred_nodes = set(o for s,p,o in G if type(o) == rdflib.term.BNode)
root_nodes = nodes - referred_nodes
```


#### Graph to Dictionary

```
def graph_to_dict(G, j, seen=frozenset()):
    d = {}
    for k, v in G.predicate_objects(j):
        k = k.toPython()
        if v in seen:
            logging.warning('Detected cycle in RDF %s', G.identifier)
            return None
        elif type(v) == rdflib.term.BNode:
            v = graph_to_dict(G, v, seen.union([v]))
        else:
            v = v.toPython()
        d[k] = d.get(k, []) + [v]
    return d
```

# Community Detection

Reichardt and Bornholdt - Statistical Mechanics of Community Detection - https://arxiv.org/pdf/cond-mat/0603718.pdf

Defines Hamiltonian spin glasses; effectively same metric as below: `\sum_{C}\sum_{i,j \in C} tA_ij - \frac{k_i k_j}{2m} `


Lambiotte, Delvenne, and Barahona - Laplacian Dynamics and Multiscale Modular Structure in Networks - https://arxiv.org/pdf/0812.1770.pdf

Defines it as a linearisation of independent, identical homogenous Poisson process (dynamics of normalised Laplacian matrix).
