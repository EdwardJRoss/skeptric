There's a lot of great freely available resources in NLP right now; and the field is moving quickly with the recent success of neural models.
I wanted to mention a few that look interesting to me.

## Jurefsky and Martin's Speech and Language Processing

The third edition is a [free ebook](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/) that is in progress that covers a lot of the basic ideas in NLP.
It's got a great reputation in the NLP community and is nearly complete now.
It makes a good starting point or reference book for a particular subject.

## Stanford CS224n: NLP with Deep Learning

This [course](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/) covers Deep Learning from NLP in Pytorch and the [2019 video lectures](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoROMvodv4rOhcuXMZkNm7j3fVwBBY42z) are great.
It's run by Chris Manning who is a leader in the field of neural chunking and parsing, and for example guided [Stanza](/stanza).

## fast.ai NLP Course

This is a lot less academic than other approaches, which gives a good contrast, in their library over Pytorch.
Lectures available [online](https://www.fast.ai/2019/07/08/fastai-nlp/); they also cover some NLP in the general [fast.ai course](https://course.fast.ai/).

## Notable free resources

These all look good, but I would start with the above 3.

* [Coursera NLP specialisation](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/natural-language-processing) from deeplearning.ai in Tensorflow
* [Training transformer](https://huggingface.co/blog/how-to-train) from Huggingface with *very* popular [transformer library](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers)
* [NLTK Book](https://www.nltk.org/book/) good for the foundations in Python
* [Yandex NLP Course](https://github.com/yandexdataschool/nlp_course) including 2019 Jupyter notebooks (English), slides and lectures (Russian)
* [CMU 2017 Neural NLP](http://phontron.com/class/nn4nlp2017/schedule.html)
* [Oxford 2017 Deep NLP](https://github.com/oxford-cs-deepnlp-2017/lectures)
* [Eistenstein's NLP notes](https://github.com/jacobeisenstein/gt-nlp-class/blob/master/notes/eisenstein-nlp-notes.pdf) - very detailed!
* [Various NLP Colab Notebooks](https://notebooks.quantumstat.com/)

Also most Deep Learning courses will tend to touch on NLP, such as [NYU 2020 Deep Learning with Pytorch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bMe_vCZo30&list=PLLHTzKZzVU9eaEyErdV26ikyolxOsz6mq&index=1).


## Resource Resources

Almost all of these and more can be found at [Awesome NLP](https://github.com/keon/awesome-nlp) and [Awesome Deep Learning for NLP](https://github.com/brianspiering/awesome-dl4nlp); they're probably more up to date too.
