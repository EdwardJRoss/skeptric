title: Null Hypothesis Data
---

Regression and Other Stories, 4.4 (And 4.5)

> In the fields in which we work, we do not generally think null hypotheses can be true: in social science and public health, just about every treatment one might consider will have *some* effect, and no comparisons or regression coefficient of interest will be *exactly* zero.
> Testing null hypotheses is just a matter of data collection: with sufficient sample size, any hypothesis can be rejected, and there is no real point to gathering a mountain of data just to reject a hypothesis that we nid not believe in the first place.

Most published research is wrong (publication bias, p-hacking, ...)
