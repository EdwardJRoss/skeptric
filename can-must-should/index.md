title: Can I? Must I? Should I?
---

Whenever someone gets an idea in their head they start filtering out evidence that contradicts that idea.
This idea is called *confirmation bias*, people start looking for evidence that confirms their current idea and neglecting evidence that challenges it.
There's no way to completely beat a bias, but something that helps me is re-framing the question.

The first question that comes is normally "Can".
Can it be?
This leads to looking for evidence that confirms the idea.

A different perspective is to re-frame the question to "Must".
Must it be?
This challenges the default setting, and starts asking for evidence that rejects the idea.

A third perspective is re-framing the question to "Should".
Should it be?
This question starts to challenge the moral and the rational parts of the brain.

When you've got a great new idea try to test it by re-framing with "can", "must", "should".
