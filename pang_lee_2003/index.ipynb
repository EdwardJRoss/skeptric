    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In July 2002 Bo Pang, Lillian Lee, and Shivakumar Vaithyanathan published [*Thumbs up? Sentiment Classification using Machine Learning Techniques.*](https://aclanthology.org/W02-1011/) at EMNLP, one of the earliest works of using machine learning for Sentiment Classification.\n",
    "It was an influential paper, [winning a test of time award](https://vimeo.com/280330773) at NAACL 2018, and at the time of writing has over 11,000 citations.\n",
    "This work led to their follow up [Seeing stars: Exploiting class relationships for sentiment categorization with respect to rating scales](https://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0506075) and this dataset was the basis for the Stanford Sentiment Treebank dataset released in [Recursive Deep Models for Semantic Compositionality Over a Sentiment Treebank](https://aclanthology.org/D13-1170.pdf) by Socher et al., which is widely used partly because of it's inclusion in GLUE.\n",
    "\n",
    "This paper aims to show that classifying the sentiment of movie reviews is a more challenging problem to develop machine learning techniques on than the existing topic classification problems, and motivate further work (in which they were successful!)\n",
    "They do this by building a self-labelled dataset of polar movie reviews from Usenet and then show baseline classifiers don't work as well as existing topic classification datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook aims to explore the paper and its methods in more detail, and the headings follow the paper section by section.\n",
    "We go much deeper into the data than the paper, and reproduce their methods, and get similar (but slightly better) results.\n",
    "A good future work would be to look into applying more modern methods on this dataset."

    "\n",
    "A lot of the papers cited in Related Work are hard to access today, or contain almost no detail.\n",
    "There are three exceptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Vasileios Hatzivassiloglou and Kathleen R. McKeown. 1997. [Predicting the Semantic Orientation of Adjectives](https://aclanthology.org/P97-1023/) mines positive and negative semantic lexicons for adjectives by looking at nearby conjunctions (e.g. \"fair and legitimate\")\n",
    "* Turney and Littman, 2002. [Unsupervised Learning of Semantic Orientation from a Hundred-Billion-Word Corpus](https://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0212012) determines whether a word is positive or negative based on whether it occurs near a positive word (like good or nice) or a negative word (like bad or poor) on the web. In particular it leveraged AltaVista's \"near\" search and calculates the Pointwise Mutual Information for each sentiment pair.\n",
    "* Peter Turney. 2002. [Thumbs Up or Thumbs Down? Semantic Orientation Applied to Unsupervised Classification of Reviews](https://aclanthology.org/P02-1053/) was concurrent with this work and uses the approach of the previous paper to classify the sentiment of reviews from epinions.com. In particular it extracts certain POS tags, works out their semantic orientation (using \"good\" as the positive term and \"poor\" as the negative), and adds the log scores for all the words in each review.\n",
    "\n",
    "This paper differs in that it uses more classical machine learning approaches with 1-hot encoded word features."

       "the brady bunch movie is less a motion picture than a minor pop event . forget your reruns and forget your nick at nite ; this dead-on recreation of the fabled seventies sitcom is both so exhilarating<span style=\"background: #f4bcbb;\"> *</span> and * so disturbing that you half-expect to see the ghost of rod serling appear in the narrative . did we really act this way twenty years ago ? of course not . the genius of the brady bunch movie is how it heightens the surreality of the family unit from hell by fast-forwarding them into the future . it&#x27;s 1995 and greg still calls the chicks &quot; groovy , &quot; and marsha still considers hair-brushing the high point of her day . bell bottoms are in , and alice has yet to move out . nothing has changed within the garish walls of brady manor and , so , the plot has the family stepping out into the real world , where they are confronted by everything from carjackers to lesbians . granted , nothing * too * serious happens here . with the exception of some heavy sexual innuendo , the brady bunch movie is about as sanitary as the source material . and that&#x27;s too bad . director betty thomas ( of tv&#x27;s &quot; hill street blues &quot; fame ) doesn&#x27;t cut between real-life and brady-life enough to make the contrast as glaring as it should be . the edge isn&#x27;t sharp enough . * we * know that what we&#x27;re watching is funky , though , so it&#x27;s not that much of a problem . nor are the glaring low production standards . the cast is uniformly appealing . shelly long seems to have found her niche under awful hair , while gary cole is right on the mark with dad&#x27;s sing-song truisms . christine taylor is the best of the brady kids . she&#x27;s a cheery delight as marsha * and * is a dead ringer for maureen mccormick . her foil is jennifer elise cox , who is a howl as the brooding jan ."

is it so unbelievable that a u . s . marshal might have to chase more than one fugitive in his lifetime ? i think not . i mean , what else was copied here ? okay , both fugitives escape via a vehicle crash . that&#x27;s one plot point . what else ? don&#x27;t use that lame &quot; a man jumped from a high place in both films &quot; excuse . a man jumped from a high place in die hard ( 1988 ) and batman &amp; robin ( 1997 ) , too , but the fugitive sure as hell isn&#x27;t a die hard clone , batman &amp; robin is by no means a fugitive clone , and so , clearly , since nothing other than a fugitive and a crash is taken from the first movie , neither is u . s . marshals just a clone of the fugitive . 2 ) even though the fact that it&#x27;s not a copy has already been adressed , let&#x27;s take a look at this . okay . let&#x27;s talk about the james bond series . it&#x27;s up to 18 films at this point . they all have bond saying &quot; bond , james bond . &quot; bond always sleeps with beautiful women . bond always uses interesting gadgets . bond always dresses suavely . bond always defeats the villian in the end . bond always makes cheesy puns . the fact that tomorrow never dies ( 1997 ) copies these elements from the other 17 films doesn&#x27;t make it horrible automatically . in fact , it received mostly favorable reviews . but , gasp ! how can that be ! it&#x27;s such a copy , it must be horrible ! after all , u . s . marshals isn&#x27;t anywhere near as copied from its first film as tomorrow never dies was from its first * 17 * , and so u . s . marshals is already bad for having copied a fugitive and a crash , right ? sure . right . whatever . 3 ) you were in the bathroom throughout the entire movie , weren&#x27;t you ? i mean . . . i can&#x27;t barely fight this one , because it&#x27;s too obvious that this is the same guy . struggling to get the job done above all else short of taking care of his teammates . barking orders powerfully even while taking a moment to smile good-naturedly and joke with his colleagues . hey , this is sam gerard . the one we loved in the fugitive . of course , it&#x27;s no longer an oscar-worthy performance , because it&#x27;s not original anymore . we&#x27;ve been here before . but still , it&#x27;s a strong character , it&#x27;s the same character , and wow , tommy lee can carry a movie . with some help of course , but we&#x27;ll get to that later . 4 ) it&#x27;s nice to have it established who sam is for those who didn&#x27;t see the fugitive ( this film does work as a stand-alone , incidentally ) , but that&#x27;s not the real reason this needs to be here . it&#x27;s nice to get reaquianted with the faces of his team that we might not remember . . . but that&#x27;s not the reason we need this here either . we need this here so that sam has a good reason to get on that plane . if not for this scene , everyone and their brother would be screaming &quot; contrived ! stupid ! &quot; when sam climbs onboard that flight . now he has a reason . aren&#x27;t you glad the filmmakers took the time to make it not contrived ? 5 ) yeah , stop chasing a man who fled from police and knows the real story behind all the weirdness that&#x27;s going on . that&#x27;d be real smart . sure . 6 ) huh ? ! he&#x27;s the fugitive that gerard chases ! he has nearly as much screen time as jones does ! he&#x27;s the reason there&#x27;s a plot here ! 7 ) so you really didn&#x27;t see this movie . you know , you really shouldn&#x27;t write reviews unless you see the movie first . i don&#x27;t want to list spoilers here , but since every scene snipes is in involves him using every method he has to track down the whole story behind his situation , i wonder , where was the person that made this comment ? 8 ) god , this is just too wrong . not only is the whole not resolved until the final five minutes , but you couldn&#x27;t even possibly predict every detail of the plot until the moment that it&#x27;s all laid out before you . 9 ) yeah , that would explain the characters who are shot , or the others who are seriously injured , during the course of the action . that&#x27;s not a danger , obviously . 10 ) when the whole &quot; conspiracy , &quot; along with the people/person behind it , is taken care of , and snipes&#x27; character&#x27;s fate is resolved , what more were you expecting ? sorry about the ranting . i apologize again . but don&#x27;t worry about it . just go out and see u . s . marshals . i mean , aren&#x27;t you getting sick of seeing titanic ( 1997 ) now ? you&#x27;ve been 47 times ! for the love of god ! just go check out u . s . marshals , and have fun . it may not be near the excellence of the fugitive ( thanks largely to less emotional involvment and no harrison ford ) , but you&#x27;ll have a good time .</span>"

       "about this complete tripe is ludicrous.</P>\r\n",
       "<P>Start off with the story, which -- as gruesomely predictable as it is --\r\n",
       "is the least offensive part of the movie. The film is inexplicably set\r\n",
       "in the 80s, a period piece that really shows no sign of its period\r\n",
       "except for a few chicks in leg warmers.  Worse yet, everyone's speaking\r\n",
       "late 90s hip-hop slang in what should be 1983.  Meant to be partially\r\n",
       "autobiographical, Carey plays Billie Frank, a young singer in New York\r\n",
       "who struggles to overcome a rough childhood and abandonment by her\r\n",

       "give away the ending, but -- honestly -- just think of unicorns and\r\n",

       "<P>The movie screams to be made with camp, and that could've been fun.  But\r\n",

    "The conclustions from the original still hold up:\n",

    "> The results produced via machine learning techniques are quite good in comparison to the human-generated baselines discussed in Section 4.\n",
    "> In terms of relative performance, Naive Bayes tends to do the worst and SVMs tend to do the best, although the differences aren’t very large.\n",
    "> On the other hand, we were not able to achieve accuracies on the sentiment classification problem comparable to those reported for standard topic-based categorization, despite the several different types of features we tried.\n",
    "> Unigram presence information turned out to be the most effective; in fact, none of the alternative features we employed provided consistently better performance once unigram presence was incorporated. \n",
    "\n",
    "They also give this analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "> As it turns out, a common phenomenon in the documents was a kind of “thwarted expectations” narrative, where the author sets up a deliberate contrast to earlier discussion.\n",

    "We now have much more advanced methods, in particular neural methods that can take the context into account.\n",

    "## On compute\n",

    "This paper was relatively easy to reproduce because computers are so much faster than when they wrote it, and software is so much better.\n",

    "It's worth keeping in mind the change in technology in the last 20 years; the fastest supercomputer in the world at the time, the [Earth Simulator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_Simulator) could perform just under 36 TFLOPS, about the same as 4 NVIDIA A100's that could be rented today in the cloud for under $5 an hour (AWS was just starting up around this time).\n",
    "\n",
    "For a more grounded comparison in 2003 Apple released the [Power Mac G5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_Mac_G5) which at the time was a powerful consumer computer, but some [benchmarks from 2017](https://www.phoronix.com/news/PowerMac-Intel-KBL) show it's around 10-100 times slower and a 7th Generation Intel i7. It had 256MB of RAM, where a mid-range laptop today would have at least 8GB, about 30 times more.\n",
    "This meant recalculating the features 9 times (once per split and per model) was a reasonable thing to do, but would have been very unreasonable at the time.\n",
    "\n",
